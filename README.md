## Description

A package for calculating climate-health indicators [beta].

First indicator is modified from Gasparrini et al. (2015).

Mortality risk attributable to high and low ambient temperature: a multicountry observational study. The Lancet. 2015;386(9991):369-375

### Folder description

- `temp_dlnm_main.R`: Runs distributed lag non-linear model (dlnm) to estimate the excess risk attributable to non-optimal outdoor temperature (modified from Gasparrini et al. 2015)
- `R`:               Contains packaged R code for each the indicators
- `data`:            Folder for storing data
- `archive`:         Archived scripts
- `man`:             Automatically generated package documentation from roxygen2 comments (do not edit manually)
- `output`:          Stores outputs from scripts
- `tests`:           Unit tests and test data
- `data_template`:   Template of input data structure and column names

## Usage

Steps to calculate indicator:

1. Change `input_csv_path` field in `config.yaml` to your input dataset (daily mortality and temperature measurements per region). 

2. Change the column titles to reflect those in the data template `data_template/regEngWales_data_template.csv` (modified from Gasparrini et al. 2015). [beta solution; can be made generalisable in function & platform]

3. Change `output_folder_path` field in `config.yaml` to the folder you want to store outputs.

4. Run `temp_dlnm_main.R` to run full analysis **OR** run `devtools:load_all()` to load indicatorfunctions package and run individual functions (individual functions located in `R/`)

To run unit tests:

  * Run `devtools::test()` in the console. Tests in `tests/testthat/`. Test data in `tests/testthat/testdata/regEngWales.csv` (from https://github.com/gasparrini/2015_gasparrini_Lancet_Rcodedata).

## Data

#### Heat-related mortality data

We are currently testing the indicator using real heat-related mortality data for England and Wales (``tests/testthat/testdata/regEngWales.csv`). The raw data is being used by our team to develop an indicator of heat-related mortality and is taken from https://github.com/gasparrini/2015_gasparrini_Lancet_Rcodedata.

This dataset contains daily number of deaths and minimum, maximum, and mean temperature, disaggregated by region (nine English regions).


## Project status

* Refining usability and developing new indicator functions
